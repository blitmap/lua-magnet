Compile with: gcc   -Wall -O2 -g -o magnet magnet.c -lfcgi -llua -lm -ldl -pedantic -ansi -std=c89
or          : clang -Wall -O2 -g -o magnet magnet.c -lfcgi -llua -lm -ldl -pedantic -ansi -std=c89
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I find clang to be so much more descriptive for errors and warnings. <3


Associate the .lua extension with the `magnet` fastcgi launcher in your web server.

On my webserver I use the spawn-fcgi program (originally from lighttpd?) like so:

	/usr/bin/spawn-fcgi -u httpd -g httpd -s /tmp/randomstring-webserver-lua.sock -f /path/to/lua-magnet

I then set a rule for all requests to files with the .lua extension to communicate
with that fastcgi server through the /tmp/randomstring-webserver-lua.sock socket.

Request: /path/to/whatever.lua

if ($Request =~ m{\.lua$})
{
	--> Query FastCGI server with SCRIPT_FILENAME='/path/to/whatever.lua'
	<-- FastCGI Server Response... (magnet response)
}

*Happy User* :D-S-<

At least, that's my understanding of it... I am *STILL LEARNING* about FastCGI
and backend-oriented webdev, but so far my attempts have worked out pretty well...

Features (so far)
-----------------

	- Caches scripts under _G.magnet.cache['<script>']
	- Keeps track of how many hits each script gets (_G.magnet.cache['<script'].hits)
	- Also exports the mtime for each script (which it uses to re-cache automagically if it has been altered)

	^ I take no credit for these. ^

	- print(...) has been overriden.
		Arguments are converted to a string (if necessary) with Lua's tostring(), which will invoke a defined __tostring).

	- Improved error-handling?
		Sends the ~correct~ response if the script can't be accessed for interpretation (403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 503 Service Unavailable).
		Errors generated when interpreting the script into bytecode are reported (200 OK, Content-Type: text/plain, error...)
		Errors generated at runtime are reported in-place with a stack trace from the "stock" debug.traceback()
	
	- Reports how many connections served through magnet.connections_served
		(connections_served = sum of all scripts' magnet.cache['<script>'].hits) 

Tip
---

You can check out the interesting CGI environment variables with
os.getenv('REQUEST_URI') or os.getenv('QUERY_STRING'), etc... it's
just up to you to parse said query string.  I've already done
something in pure Lua which you can view at http://partyvan.us/lua/bleh.lua,
the source is icky and viewable with '&highlight' appended: http://partyvan.us/lua/bleh.lua&highlight

List of CGI Environment Variables
---------------------------------

	- 'AUTH_TYPE'
	- 'CONTENT_LENGTH'
	- 'CONTENT_TYPE'
	- 'DOCUMENT_ROOT'
	- 'GATEWAY_INTERFACE'
	- 'HTTP_ACCEPT'
	- 'HTTP_COOKIE'
	- 'HTTP_HOST'
	- 'HTTP_REFERRER'
	- 'HTTP_USER_AGENT'
	- 'HTTPS'
	- 'PATH'
	- 'PATH_INFO'
	- 'PATH_TRANSLATED'
	- 'QUERY_STRING',
	- 'REMOTE_ADDR'
	- 'REMOTE_HOST'
	- 'REMOTE_IDENT'
	- 'REMOTE_USER'
	- 'REQUEST_METHOD'
	- 'REQUEST_URI'
	- 'SCRIPT_NAME'
	- 'SCRIPT_FILENAME'
	- 'SERVER_ADMIN'
	- 'SERVER_NAME'
	- 'SERVER_PORT'
	- 'SERVER_PROTOCOL',
	- 'SERVER_SIGNATURE'
	- 'SERVER_SOFTWARE'

	- Note: Please let me know if there is some standard for all
	that exist, I have checked the original CGI site, but I keep
	finding more standard-yet-non-standard conventional CGI vars
	exported by my webserver.  Just curious what is common.

Roadmap
-------

	DO WANT:
		- Export all the CGI environment variables under magnet.env
			- Find out the standard for parsing the QUERY_STRING if it is defined. -.-
				- I believe ; or & is the (conventional?) record separator... need more info.

	Low Priority: (luaFilesystem works spendidly for now)
		- Add a function for listing a directory which returns each item (return file1, file2, file3 -- varargs-like)
		- Add a function for stat()'ing a file.  Return attributes like ^ ?
